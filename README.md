# 1984-Notes-Website-Project
Project for 1984. 

For this creative project in my English II class, I chose to create an interactive website as an extension of ideas posed in the novel. 

This project takes text input and checks if any of the written words are within a set dictionary of 'sinful words.' If so, it changes them to the more acceptable corresponding words in the dictionary. 

The project was inspired by the the novel 1984 by George Orwell. In the novel, the main character is observed comitting 'throughtcrime' by writing somewhate revolutionary phrases in a notebook. This more advanced writing medium allows for increased regulation and control over the ponderings and thoughts of individuals.

In this instance, the sinful words are 'love' and 'rebellion'
