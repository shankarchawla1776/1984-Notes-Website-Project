# 1984-Notes-Website-Project
Website project for 1984 

This project takes text input and checks if any of the written words are within a set dictionary of 'sinful word.' If so, it changes them to corresponding words in the dictionary. 

The project was inspired by the the novel 1984 by George Orwell. In the novel, the main character is observed comitting 'throughtcrime' by writing somewhate revolutionary phrases in a notebook. This more advanced writing medium allows for increased regulation and control over the ponderings and thoughts of individuals.
